🐱‍🏍ABOUT ME

- 👋 Hi, I am Ovezmurat Altiyev, an ISTQB Certified Tester(specialising in cross-functional testing), learning how to code and test./
- 👨‍💻 I’m interested in testing software applications. I enjoy contributing to projects and am really enthusiastic about learning new technology.
In 2021, I learnt Core Java, Lambda expressions, and JDBC. From 2022 to now, I have learnt Selenium, Selenium Grid, Cucumber, Playwright, API testing, JMeter, SQL, Jenkins, HTML, and CSS. I am pretty confident in software testing with software applications.
- 🌱 Every day is a learning day for me. 
- ⚽ Outside the world of tech, too, I love playing football too much and hiking as well. 
📖📚 I love reading books on personal development. My favourite one is The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari by Robin Sharma. That is pretty much about me, I guess. 
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborating on Java projects.
