🐱‍🏍ABOUT ME

- 👋 Hi, I am Ovezmurat Altiyev, an ISTQB Certified Tester(specializing in cross functional testing) learning how to code and testing./
- 👨‍💻 I’m interested in testing software applications. I enjoy contributing to projects and am really enthusiastic about learning new technology.
In 2021, I learnt Core Java, Lambda expressions and JDBC. In 2022 till now, I learnt Selenium, Selenium Grid, Cucumber, API testing, JMeter, SQL and a bit about Jenkins. I also got started with HTML and CSS. 
- 🌱 Every day is a learning day for me. 
- ⚽ Outside the world of tech too, I love playing football too much. 
- 📖📚 I love reading books on personal development. My favourite one is The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari by Robin Sharma in the genre of personal development. That is pretty much about me I guess. 
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborating in Java projects.
